SYSTEM monitoring
System monitoring refers to the continuous observation and analysis of a computer system's performance and health.
 This process involves tracking stats to ensure that the system operates efficiently and to find issiues with the computer.
 Key components of system monitoring include:

 1. Resource Usage Tracking
CPU Usage: Monitoring the processor's load and utilization to ensure itâ€™s not overloaded.
Memory Usage: Checking RAM consumption to prevent slowdowns or crashes.
Disk Usage: Observing available disk space and I/O operations to manage storage effectively.
Network Activity: Tracking bandwidth usage and network connections to ensure smooth communication.

2. Performance Metrics
Monitoring response times, transaction rates, and other performance indicators to gauge system responsiveness.

3. System Health Checks
Regular checks on hardware components (like disk health and temperature) to prevent failures.
Monitoring software services to ensure they are running and responsive.

4. Alerts and Notifications
Setting up alerts for strange conditions (e.g., high CPU usage or low disk space) to notify administrators.

5. Logging and Analysis
Collecting logs from various components to analyze past behavior and troubleshoot issues.

6. Tools and Tech
Using monitoring tools (like Nagios, Zabbix, Prometheus, or Grafana) to see data and automate monitoring processes.

commands for system monitoring:
top: displays REAL-time info about running processes
htop: enhanced version of top
df: displays disk space usage
uptime: shows how long the system has been running

SECURITY

user management
delete: deluser {option below} (username)
options:
--remove-home: deletes user's home directory as well as the user
--remove-all-files: deletes user's files (all of them)
--force: Forces a delete of user, no questions asked
*make sure you delete somebody in the root directory

fire wall basics:

Types of Firewalls
Packet Filtering Firewall: Inspects a little bit of the message (packets) and allows or blocks them based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
Stateful Inspection Firewall: Monitors the state of active connections and makes decisions based on the context of traffic.
Proxy Firewall: Acts as an intermediary between users and the internet, filtering requests and responses.
Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW): Combines traditional firewall capabilities with additional features like intrusion detection and application awareness.

Key Concepts
Rules: Firewalls operate based on rules that define which traffic is allowed or denied.
Zones: Networks can be segmented into zones (e.g., internal, external, DMZ) to apply different rules.
Logging: Firewalls can log traffic and events for monitoring and auditing purposes.

What is UFW?
UFW is a kids version of a Firewall, it inables humans to understand the Firewall's rules
To enable UFW type (sudo ufw enable) no caps 
To disable UFW type (sudo ufw disable) no caps 
check UFW (sudo ufw status) no caps
how to allow a port: (sudo ufw allow [port_number])
how to deny a port (sudo ufw deny [port_number])
