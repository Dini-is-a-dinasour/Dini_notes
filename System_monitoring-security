SYSTEM monitoring
System monitoring refers to the continuous observation and analysis of a computer system's performance and health.
 This process involves tracking stats to ensure that the system operates efficiently and to find issiues with the computer.
 Key components of system monitoring include:

 1. Resource Usage Tracking
CPU Usage: Monitoring the processor's load and utilization to ensure itâ€™s not overloaded.
Memory Usage: Checking RAM consumption to prevent slowdowns or crashes.
Disk Usage: Observing available disk space and I/O operations to manage storage effectively.
Network Activity: Tracking bandwidth usage and network connections to ensure smooth communication.

2. Performance Metrics
Monitoring response times, transaction rates, and other performance indicators to gauge system responsiveness.

3. System Health Checks
Regular checks on hardware components (like disk health and temperature) to prevent failures.
Monitoring software services to ensure they are running and responsive.

4. Alerts and Notifications
Setting up alerts for strange conditions (e.g., high CPU usage or low disk space) to notify administrators.

5. Logging and Analysis
Collecting logs from various components to analyze past behavior and troubleshoot issues.

6. Tools and Tech
Using monitoring tools (like Nagios, Zabbix, Prometheus, or Grafana) to see data and automate monitoring processes.
