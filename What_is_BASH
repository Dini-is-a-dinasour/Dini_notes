Bash, which stands for "Bourne Again SHell," is a command-line interpreter widely used in Linux and other operating systems.
 It serves several key purposes:

Command Execution: Bash allows users to use commands and run programs directly from the terminal.

Scripting: Users can write scripts to automate tasks, from simple file operations to complex system management tasks.

File Manipulation: Bash provides commands to create, delete, move, and manage files and directories.

Process Control: It allows users to manage processes, including starting, stopping, and monitoring running programs.

Environment Customization: Users can configure their shell environment by setting variables and creating aliases to streamline their workflow.

User Interaction: Bash supports user input and provides tools for prompting and handling input/output, making it suitable for interactive scripts.
