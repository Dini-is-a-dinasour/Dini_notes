A Bash script is a plain text file which contains a series of commands. These commands are a mixture of commands we would normally type ouselves
 on the command line (such as ls or cp for example) and commands we could type on the command line but generally wouldn't.

HOW TO USE BASH 
A typical Bash script starts with a "shebang" (#!/bin/bash), which tells the system to use the Bash interpreter to run the script.

purpose of (#!/bin/bash) 
Interpreter Directive: It tells the operating system which interpreter to use to execute the script. In this case, it specifies that the script should be run using the Bash shell located at /bin/bash.

Portability: Including the shebang ensures that the script can be executed on any system where Bash is installed, without needing to specify the interpreter explicitly each time you run the script.

Script Execution: When you run a script with the shebang line, the system knows to invoke Bash to interpret the commands in the script.
