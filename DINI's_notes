How to access notes: 

Type: DINI (like that) 

 


  

how do networks work? 

Devices: 

Computers, smartphones, printers, etc. 

Each has a unique IP address. 

 

Data Transmission: 

Data is sent as messages. 

Travels over cables or wirelessly. 

 

Routers: 

Act as post offices directing data. 

Forward messages between devices and the internet. 

 

Ports: 

Each device has multiple ports for different services. 

 

Direct data to specific applications (e.g., email, web browsing). 

Protocols: 

Sets of rules for communication (like neighborhood rules). 

Ensure data is sent and received correctly (e.g., TCP/IP). 

Firewalls: 

Security measures to protect networks. 

Block unauthorized access and filter traffic. 

Types of Networks: 

LAN (Local Area Network): Connects devices in a small area (like a home or office). 

WAN (Wide Area Network): Connects devices over larger distances (like the internet). 

Switches: 

Connect devices within a LAN. 

Forward data to specific devices based on MAC addresses. 

Permisions (Octal notatiem)
example (-|r-x|rw-|rw-)
r: read
x: executable
w: write
-: nothing
each section indecated by "|" is a section of persons
the first one before the first "|" is what the permission is permissioning, - is file and d is directory
the second section is what the owner of that file/directory can do
the third one is what the group (connected to the owner) can do
the last one is what anyone else can do
normaly, chomd +x is what is used for activating the file, but it allowes anyone with the file, including strangers, to exicute it.
Though, with Octal notatiem, you can change the permisions on how u like
to do this do;

chmod _ _ _ (numbers are spaced)
the order of underlines are: owner, group and other
you must use numbers in order to activate chmod (btw chmod is "change modifacation")
here are the numbers:
7 = rwx
6 = rw-
5 = r-x
4 = r--
3 = -wx
2 = -w-
1 = --x
0 = ---
