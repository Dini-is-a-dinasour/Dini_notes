Here are some definitions of things that can be tied to security
btw I will be placing the "security tie in" seperate to the definition

1.
Government(s)
definition:
Government is a leader that controls a certian group, this could range from a comunity or a nation. They make majority of decisions and decide what is and what is not.
security:
In the security aspect of a government, it is very large. As a government has both community available items but also at the same time have very dangerous knowledge. That knowlegde must be kept within the government so
they need a huge amount of security. The security can range from guards, to only having one person know.

2.
Society
definition:
the community of people living in a country while having shared perspectives, laws, and organizations.
security:
A society is a Community (look below) but it could be larger. In my opinion it doesnt have any security as there is nothing to protect. I also think that a society is a way to group multiple individuals. They dont
need to know eachother, they just get grouped together.


3.
Community
definition:
a group of people living in the same place or have close relation to one in other.
security:
In order to have a friendly and workable community (which is what makes it), you must make trust and, keeping secrets is not possible. A society (in my opinion) must gain trust with one another. 
They must keep problems in the open and basicly give no privacy in community problems. There are literal apps/ websites that share what is happening within the community. iF is that easy to simply
open a website or download an app, there is zero to no privacy. Of course, there is allways the possibility that people are not sharing on those websites/apps.

4.
legislation
definition:
Creates and runs laws as a group. (my definition)
security:
In my opinion, Legislatives have somewhat security. I say that because all they do is to make laws and make sure it works.

5.
law vs by-law
law: the system of rules which a particular country or community recognizes as regulating the actions of its members and which it may enforce by the imposition of penalties.
by-law:  A regulation created by a local authority or an organization to govern the affairs of that locale or organization.
security:
In my opinion, by-law's have less security then laws. That is because by-laws are local or a small organization. Laws on the otherhand, can reach up to an international level.

6.
legal vs illegal
legal: of, based on, or concerned with the law.
illegal: not according to or authorized by law.
security:
I think that illegal has more security (agaist it) then legal. Doing illegal things are negative to the society, therefore there are large measures taken to stop illegal behaviour.

7.
Privacy
definition:
the state or condition of being free from being observed or disturbed by other people.
security:
Privacy is the middle grounds of security. On one hand, privacy means no one else can disturb or observe what you are doing, on the other, that can also apply to somebody killing you. privacy is both good and bad
for there own reasons, thats why I placed it in the middle

8.
Information security
definition:
protecting information by removing information risks.
security: 
Due to the fact it literaly has security in the name, I would place it as the highest amount of security. This security is a security that stops people from viewing or making changes to your info.


9.
Security
definition:
the state of being free from danger or threat.
security:
Security is a way to ensure some one from danger or threat. security wise, security is very secure.

10.
Operational security (Opsec)
definition:
OPSEC is a security and risk management process that prevents sensitive information from getting into the wrong hands. 
security:
This is a very complex security measure that basicly is a information security. It is very powerful as sensitive data are worth a lot.
OPsec is cool.

11.

12.

13. Private company

14 Nonprofit organization/company

15. Not of profit organ/company
